= How can I help? =
If you want to help us to translate CSipSimple in your language, here's the good place.

We use miracle2k's android2po tool and the Roseta project from Launchpad to translate CSipSimple. That's more user friendly than plain xml files!

Any way, be really careful with xml quotes, and xml tags if any !


So, how t help this software translation :

 # Register on Launchpad. You can use an openID - so your google account should enough.
 # Go to csipsimple translations : https://translations.launchpad.net/csipsimple/trunk
 # Choose your language and use webinterface to contribute 

If you encounter any problem, let us know. But in most case Launchpad tutorials should be enough.
